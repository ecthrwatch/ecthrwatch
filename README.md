### Executive Summary (Less than 2 min read)

**The Crimes**  
McDonald’s ran global promotional games, falsely presenting them as fair games of chance. In reality, the company repeatedly misrepresented the odds of winning, often outright falsifying the real probabilities. This was not just deceptive marketing. It was calculated fraud of the most vicious kind.

These mafia-like methods constitute mass-marketing consumer fraud and money laundering. They also fall within the scope of the **United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (Palermo Convention)**, in particular Article 5, which criminalizes participation in an organized criminal group and serious offenses committed intentionally across borders.

**The Scale of the Crimes**  
Over more than three decades, McDonald’s deceived billions of people across dozens of countries. The total economic impact includes the loss of a legitimate chance to win prizes, market manipulation, and unfair competitive advantage. Altogether, the value affected likely reaches into the trillions of dollars. Tens of thousands of franchisees, though legally distinct, helped implement these schemes. While many may claim ignorance, their conduct often reveals criminal negligence. If the law were properly enforced, McDonald’s and its franchisees would be declared bankrupt and criminally prosecuted.

**France’s Guilty Silence, U.S. Intelligence Steps In**  
In France, court documents were falsified multiple times. McDonald’s appears to have received internal protection involving high-ranking officials, magistrates (including public prosecutors and judges), and lawmakers who failed in their constitutional duty of parliamentary oversight. This protection may have reached as high as ministers, prime ministers, and possibly even President Emmanuel Macron. If confirmed, this would constitute a major constitutional crisis.

In China, where I currently reside, I was contacted by individuals I had already been in contact with. They had previously offered me to work for them, without disclosing who they truly were. It was only after they acknowledged the seriousness of McDonald’s crimes that they identified themselves as U.S. intelligence operatives. After revealing their true identity, they renewed their offer for me to work with them.

**Peaceful Coexistence Between Nations, Under God**  
I love both China and the United States. But I love my wife and my parents-in-law even more. My father-in-law is a retired CPC official. Accepting an offer from the American military intelligence services would have placed my family in serious danger. I now live under the constant threat of retaliation, not only from Chinese authorities, but also from France and the United States.  
The only path I can follow with a ***clear conscience*** is to live by my *faith*, to answer to God rather than to governments, and to remain loyal to truth, justice, and the ideal of peaceful coexistence between nations, as a moral duty before God.
